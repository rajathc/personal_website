<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Greetings!</p>
    
<p>I’m <b>Rajath Chandrahasa</b>, a Postgraduate in Computational Chemistry from the <a href="https://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>.</p>
<p>Since January 2023, I’ve been working as a <a href="https://brokenatom.io/">Product Manager at Brokenatom</a>, bringing ideas to life and solving interesting challenges. I also had my own startup for two years, which gave me a lot of hands-on experience and shaped my entrepreneurial thinking.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about my background or work, feel free to drop me an email.</p>
