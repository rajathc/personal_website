<p>In the fast-paced world of startups, a successful product launch can make or break your business. This is especially true for Product Hunt launches, the go-to platform for early adopters and tech enthusiasts. Back in October 2023, we at <a href="https://brokenatom.io/" target="_blank">Brokenatom, a no-code web application builder</a>, decided on our first Product Hunt launch. With a well-defined strategy and a dedicated team, we not only secured <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/broken-enterprises_producthunt-makersgonnamake-startups-activity-7125543013811904513-6Ske" target="_blank"> #2 Product of the Day</a> spot but also accumulated nearly <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/brokenatom#brokenatom" target="_blank"> 800 upvotes</a> by the end of the launch.</p>

<p>This blog post is your roadmap to replicating our success. I'll share the strategies that propelled us to the top, the pitfalls we dodged, and the valuable lessons learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="pre-launch">Pre-launch Strategy</h2>

<p>I was tasked with the launch in August, giving me a two-month head start. Leading up to the launch, I was unfamiliar with Product Hunt, having previously worked in the FMCG manufacturing industry. So, I decided to research online and speak to a few of my college seniors who had successful launches to get a good idea of the expected KPIs. I have embedded my presentation with these findings; feel free to use it to present to your team.</p>

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="https://brokenentrepreneursprivatel-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rajath_brokenatom_io/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={ee2676db-bedd-42cc-af48-504c29b0059c}&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe>
</div>

<p>You can find my detailed strategy in the presentation. I also recommend asking your friends or family to sign up on Product Hunt at least two weeks before the launch so that their accounts are warmed up. Another suggestion is to create an account with LinkedIn, as LinkedIn-linked accounts&#39; upvotes have been known to have a higher weightage than recently created accounts.</p>

<p>Since I have spoken about the weightage, now is a good time to talk about what I mean by it. Not all upvotes are equal on Product Hunt. There is a rating system on the accounts and a few other mechanisms to prevent people from abusing the system. This is to prevent people from creating new accounts and also to prevent botting for upvotes. So it is better to get existing accounts than spam votes with newly created accounts on the day.</p>

<h2 id="building-hype">Building Hype</h2>

<p>At Brokenatom, we posted teasers every day on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/broken-enterprises/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenatom.io/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/brokenatom_io" target="_blank">Twitter</a> leading up to the launch. We also sent a newsletter before the launch and on the day of the launch to our email list. It&#39;s better to start a countdown a week in advance. </p>

    <p class="caption">Our Launch gif which was posted across social media</p>
</div>

<p>Another great Product Hunt strategy would be for the team members to start using and commenting on Product Hunt. That way, they are going to build a small following on Product Hunt and who could help them on the launch.</p>

<h2 id="product-page">Product Page</h2>

<p>I know I have been speaking about accumulating upvotes, and it might sound like I am trying to gamify Product Hunt. But the fact of the matter is that without being at the top, it&#39;s hard for serious users to notice your product. So, we need to play it carefully leading up to the launch and on the launch day so that the product is high on the list. That way, more people can check out the product page.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img class="blog-image" alt="" src="/images/blog/04-product-hunt/2.png"/>
    <p class="caption">Our Launch gif which was posted across social media</p>
</div>

<p>Speaking of the product page, it is a must to spend more time selecting the images, making a teaser/demo video, and writing the description. It is also wise to write a maker&#39;s comment on the page explaining the process of building the product and sharing their personal story. Make sure the page looks professional so that people take the product seriously and it doesn&#39;t look like vaporware.</p>

<h2 id="launch-day">Launch Day</h2>

<p>We launched at 12 am PST. The way Product Hunt works is that the product listings get refreshed at the end of the day. <strong>There is no reason to launch at any other time</strong>, as it would put you in a disadvantageous situation and make your product visible for less than 24 hours. So, no need to launch later in the day.</p>

<p>Since I have not mentioned what day to choose for the launch earlier (details can be found in the presentation), make sure to <strong>launch on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday</strong>. The other four days have a noticeable drop-off in traction and website traffic. In short, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday &gt; Monday and Friday &gt; Saturday &gt; Sunday. People don&#39;t check LinkedIn or Product Hunt over the weekends.</p>

<h2 id="engagement">Engagement</h2>

<p>We divided the connections to hit throughout the launch day. By front-loading the upvotes, we managed to be at the top of the charts after the first four hours of the launch. This way, we started receiving upvotes and sign-ups from other Product Hunt users outside our circle.</p>

<p>We had prepared a common Excel sheet for the personal contacts before the launch. We just had to hit up people in Europe and the USA during their time zones. We also tried our best to <strong>reply to the comments</strong> on the launch day. This increases engagement on the launch post. </p>

<p>It was not completely stressful; after the launch, we had a team dinner to celebrate our launch as this was Brokenatom&#39;s first public launch. But we were back after the dinner to burn the midnight oil replying to comments and keeping the engagement running.</p>

<h2 id="team-involvement">Team Involvement</h2>

<p>It&#39;s important to divide the tasks before the launch and to divide the time when the team is going to be online during the 24-hour launch. In addition, the tech team, design team, and respective teams were answering questions on their domains. That way, we could answer the questions appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="post-launch-phase">Post-Launch Phase</h2>

<h3 id="follow-up">Follow-up Activities</h3>

<p>Our launch was successful; we received a lot of media traction and gathered almost 230 emails from the launch. After the launch, we took a day off to regain our energy and acted upon the user feedback from the Product Hunt page. We also received several inquiries and leads thanks to the launch. We acted upon them and spoke to those parties. The launch generated a lot of traffic for our page.</p>

<h3 id="lessons">Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>The strategy I researched before the launch worked, hence I am sharing the presentation. But I don&#39;t know if all of them will continue to work as Product Hunt keeps tweaking its algorithm. 
I also learned what it takes to launch a product. Since our first launch, I have made it my personal goal to track every aspect of the product, not just focus on the design and development. I run through an idea in terms of marketing and business decisions, thus trying to be a better PM. As a PM, product launches are the bread and butter of the job, but doing a major launch on Product Hunt not only gives us the required boost in terms of users, but also instills a sense of importance in these launches.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>

<h3 id="recommendations">Additional Recommendations</h3>

<ol>
<li>Avoid Paid Hunters: Please don&#39;t pay any growth hackers or other hustlers to hunt your product. It is against the terms and conditions and diminishes the essence of Product Hunt.</li>
<li>Use Hunted.Space: Use <a href="https://hunted.space/" target="_blank">Hunted.Space</a> to track the likes of all the products in the first four hours of the launch. It also provides a dashboard with comments, upvotes, and everything you need to stay up-to-date with what&#39;s happening with other companies.</li>
</ol>
