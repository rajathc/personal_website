<p>What started as a simple curiosity soon turned into a passionate project that consumed my weekend. Join me as I dive into the intricate world of Gundam model building, one piece at a time. In this blog post, I'd like to share my learnings in user experience, gamification, and some of my ramblings about hobbies in general. </p>

<h2 id="the-spark-of-interest">The Spark of Interest</h2>

<p>I always wanted to build my own Gundam. I recall watching characters in the anime, build three-dimensional models from almost flat, 'two-dimensional' runners. The fact that there would be no glues or any other forms of adhesives involved was all the more surprising.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, I was part of <a href="https://rakshakiitb.in/" target="_blank">Rakshak, IIT Bombay</a>, where we built RC planes from scratch. During that time, I was bitten by the Gundam itch, but considering my student allowances and the high cost of Gundams (I recall HG RX-78 being 7.5k INR), it was an unattainable hobby.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2024. I had moved on from this dream, now older and much busier with life and adult responsibilities. I had not considered purchasing a Gundam until my brother gifted me one for my birthday.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-gundam">Choosing the Gundam</h2>

<p>Luckily, I didn't have to go through the headache of choosing the model. My brother got me an RG (Real Grade) <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Chars-Counterattack-Gundam-Bandai-144/dp/B07R3YS8R2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GT8VFK023ZQX&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g-2v3Z_GRdcHltY9SCMdpQ0vpNFFqJ1FMeAuEnmDWt7wTBNXm7siv2uwJl9z3GcFynldTdzpe5DeA17xX5kLXtj86AqDp7If7MiBR2g_SPzEnGE1Bc1vwGyd7S7D4ERKTd35pSBT6ajfbam43spsTlh3-tDU-EICZasNEU4LnihCtvYTXastMeI2u5czUFWWN4peFicwfuVC6HHaoKBu5Kyvk7Pplp21rKDNB_PpGo_8-T_s1tD_F6uttj_6Z2uLLGkMsEsxv2h9WMbk0OCFtXdvOzbR1CBTfhJ2MsWCEhU.du5BUg_9vHTyb_BFfhcF1ZGRdfK9zq_MIlDwka3Rtz4&dib_tag=se&keywords=nu+gundam&qid=1720195083&sprefix=nu+g%2Caps%2C226&sr=8-1" target="_blank">RX-93 Nu Gundam</a>, which is regarded as one of the best Gundams. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh1Ii662nJg" target="_blank">this review</a> that convinced my brother to get this particular Gundam. Alternatively, you could go with an <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Bandai-Hobby-RX-78-2-Gundam-Revive/dp/B00WW4F8YA/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1C8GMECHCBU87&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5SLTy4eWIe0xWYla5L_OCZ9sL_VsL-wPkvA_L5oO3JcEt79eKi61a4VByURAn8izKYhjoxwhBMqo48b1ZRcU58Ykx3ezVKYlOb_GEj5K4eLrR539rr_nh6LvmC8873DqPC6KUZCZjCHPzfiwg4D-I4UOs6BZF9jHwBHtCxF91DKcttlncT1jX0AdRZ4CflkFVhnPfiWbPPXW9Zhe-mUNXtFpmP-GDDpJbU5VkKitV5jSGqVUSKUDqI7Xy63qRquPq1pFithfEN2wEuLppyWaw8aMePTvVA3bQu5wYEkgSmw.a8Jq4QSKpQZUlRW589ojFjZXEAa3t1zph1OF1njIpw0&dib_tag=se&keywords=rx78+gundam&qid=1720195211&sprefix=rx78+gundam%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-1" target="_blank">HG (High Grade) RX-78]</a>.</p>
<p>While this isn't a beginner's guide, my only advice is to get something in HG or RG. The newer the model, the better its quality and engineering.</p>

<h2 id="tools-and-supplies">Tools and Supplies</h2>

<p>I purchased a few tools based on online recommendations and my brother's suggestions. Here are the essentials:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The best nipper you can find</li>
    <li>A bent tweezer</li>
    <li>A hobby knife</li>
</ul>
<p>Other tools are optional but here's the rest of the tools I used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sanding papers (600, 800, 1000, 1200, 2000 grits)</li>
    <li>Set of Tweezers</li>
    <li>Cutting board as a workspace</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-process">Building Process</h2>
<h3 id="unboxing">1. Unboxing</h3>

<p>Before I say anything about the unboxing experience, I must declare my love for the package design of Japanese products. It's full of information, unlike minimalist packaging which I find fatiguing.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img class="blog-image" src="/images/blog/02-gundam/IMG_1346.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Declaring my love for this box again!</p>
</div>

<p>Unboxing is fairly straightforward. After removing two seals, I lifted the box to reveal multiple runners in plastic packages and a manual. At first glance, it seems like there are too many parts, but fear not. There are numbers and labels throughout the build and on the runners, so take a breather—it’s not as intimidating as it seems.</p>

<h3 id="building-process-details">2. Building Process</h3>

<p>I don't want to go too deep into the build process, as this isn't a step-by-step guide. However, be prepared to dedicate 10-30 hours for building, depending on your focus, obsession with details, and dexterity. It took me 17 hours in total—15 hours for building and 2 hours for stickering and final details.</p>

<h3>Here are my few tips for building Gundam:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prepping the Pieces:</strong> Use a nipper to cut the plastic, a blade to remove excess plastic, and sandpaper to clean the nub marks—in that order.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> If something doesn’t feel right, you’re likely doing it wrong. There were many instances where I had to reassemble parts because of incorrect orientation. Look for that satisfying click during assembly.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading the Manual:</strong> Self-explanatory, but crucial. Read the manual carefully to avoid mistakes and understand each step thoroughly.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm still learning to pose the Gundam, but rest assured, I’ll update this post with better photos when I have them.</p>

<p>I loved the model when the building process was done, but it was the stickering and fine detailing that truly dialed up the build.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-and-takeaway">Reflection and My Takeaway as a Product Person</h2>
<p>I can’t put into words how much engineering goes into making these Gundams. I’ve read online that it only gets better every year. It’s a fully articulated action figure with an inner frame built from "2-dimensional" looking, plastic runners.</p>

<p>The build process is carefully crafted. Here’s how it’s gamified:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Start Simple:</strong> In Gundam's case, it’s usually the leg pieces. They’re larger and more forgiving for beginners. This part helps you get hands-on experience before the complexity increases.</li>
    <li><strong>Make it Rewarding:</strong> The build is planned with checkpoints throughout. Whether you have one hour or two, you can complete a section and feel accomplished. This segmented approach keeps you motivated.</li>
    <li><strong>Satisfying Clicks:</strong> Visual, audible, or tactile validation that you’re doing it right. The satisfying clicks during assembly assure you that you’re on the right track.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It took me a while to finally start my first Gundam build, but it was a highly satisfying hobby. Now, I’m waiting for the action base to ship from Japan and thinking about my next Gundam. I also plan to watch the Gundam anime sometime soon.</p>
<p>If you've ever considered building a Gundam or are simply curious about this hobby, I encourage you to take the leap.</p>
